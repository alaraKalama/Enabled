# Enabled
-
Course project for Telerik Academy iOS Development Course

##The Idea

"Enabled" is an localized for Bulgarian users application that aims to provide information about places' accessibility for wheelchair users.
There are many similar apps but non of them are adjusted for Bulgarians and that is the reason to develop it in bulgarian language.

##Functionality
The user mainly interacts with a map view and can observe nearby places, search for specific address and add a missing place.
Every place can be rated depending on its level of accessibility and the general accessibility level is calculated based on the number of votes. 
A place can also be reviewed and can have images. 

The application uses:
--

* Firebase as a backend
* Google Maps SDK for iOS
* Custom View for Map Markers

Device APIs:

* Camera
* Geolocation
* Connection
* Compass? (maybe)

In addition to this I am connecting the project to my work in "MS-Moga Sam" foundation based in Sofia, Bulgaria. The purpose of our work is to help people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and other disabilities as well. We provide information about living with disabilities and alternative treatments, we raise awareness about the important role that diet and exercise play in being healthy, we organise support networks and search for ways to assist people on everyday basis. Last but not least, “MS - Moga Sam” fights for creating better accessibility for everyone.
